<body>
    <h1>What is your favorite culture that you're not native to?</h1>
    <p>All branches of the United States Military. The amount of discipline they drill into you is something that I respect, and even admire.</p>

    <h1>Build a bouquet of 3 flowers that represent you in the language of flowers.</h1>
    <p>Fair warning, I decided to opt for the plants' <a href="https://thursd.com/articles/flowers-in-the-bible-10-significant-varieties-and-their-meanings">biblical significance</a>, instead of the recommended resources.</p>
    <p>"But I am like a green olive tree in the house of God: I trust in the mercy of God forever and ever." (Psalm 52:8)
        The olive tree holds significant symbolism in the Bible, representing peace, prosperity, and the presence of God. 
        The olive tree is also a symbol of endurance and resilience, as it can live for centuries and withstand harsh conditions. 
        In the quoted verse, the psalmist compares himself to an olive tree in God's house, expressing his trust in God's mercy and protection.</p>

    <p>"The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed, which a man took and planted in his field." (Matthew 13:31)
        The mustard seed is used in the Bible as a metaphor for faith and the growth of God's kingdom. 
        Though small in size, the mustard seed grows into a large plant, symbolizing the transformative power of faith and the expansion of God's influence in the world.</p>

    <p>"Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean; wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow." (Psalm 51:7)
        Hyssop, an aromatic herb, is used in the Bible as a symbol of purification and spiritual cleansing. 
        In the quoted verse, the psalmist asks God to cleanse him from his sins, using hyssop as a metaphor for the cleansing power of God's forgiveness and mercy.</p>
